In order to make it practical for application developers to utilize Pilot in
proprietary products, Pilot is treated as a "free software library"
under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.  This makes it
permissible to compile applications with the Pilot headers and link them with the
library's binaries, without forcing the GPL onto the application's source
code.  That is, developers may keep their own application source code proprietary.

Note that any modifications made to Pilot fall under the GPL and must be returned
to the Open Source community.
