INSTALL instructions for Pilot
==============================
:date: 30 Jan 2017
:version: Version 3.1

Here's what you need to get Pilot compiled and installed:

    * The Pilot source distribution of your choice
    * Your favourite MPI implementation
    * If you want to be able to generate/view visual logs of Pilot API calls, you will need the MPE library, which includes the Jumpshot-4 viewer (requires JDK 8 or higher). MPE can be downloaded for free from `Argonne National Lab <http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/perfvis/download/>`_.
    * If you would like to run the unit tests, you will need CUnit (version 2.1 or higher)
    * To generate and install the documentation, you will need Python (2.4 or higher) with Docutils, and Doxygen (1.5.6 or higher)


Building Pilot
==============

Configure the Makefile
----------------------

    NOTE: You can avoid having to edit the Makefile if you simply want to define the
    PREFIX and MPEHOME variables. In that case you can type "make MPEHOME=/that/path"
    and "make install PREFIX=/your/path" at the Compile step below.
    
    Change the variable PREFIX to point to the directory that you wish pilot to
    be installed in. The pilot header files will be installed in
    $(PREFIX)/include and the library will be installed in $(PREFIX)/lib. Note
    that if these directories do not already exist, an attempt is made to create
    them.
    
    If you installed MPE, uncomment and change the variable MPEHOME to its location.
    This should be the parent directory of "include" and "lib". If you leave the variable
    commented out, Pilot will not attempt to build with the MPE library and selecting
    "-pisvc=j" on the command line will give a warning.
    
    If you plan on running the tests, you may need to edit tests/Makefile. Uncomment and
    change CUNITHOME to where you installed that package. If you are building Pilot with
    MPE, you also need to uncomment/change MPEHOME and LDFLAGS.

    If your C compiler for MPI is not installed in a standard place, you will also
    have to change the variable CC to point to the proper compiler.

    Note that if you install Pilot to a non-standard directory, then you will
    have to make sure that the install directory is in your include and library
    path. You can use the mpicc -I and -L options to set those paths.

Compile
-------

    Once the Makefile has been configured, you can run::

        $ make
        $ make install

    If you don't need the Fortran API, type "make cpilot" instead of "make".
    
    For information on how to build and run the unit tests, see the README in
    the "tests" directory.


Installing the Manual Pages
===========================

    Pilot comes with a set of man pages to serve as reference material. These
    man pages are in the "docs" directory. If you would like to install these
    pages for system wide access, you can set the DOC_PREFIX variable in the
    main Makefile and then run::

        $ make install-man

    If you would like to view these man pages without installing them, you can
    change your MANPATH to include the "docs" directory. Alternatively, you can
    run man in the current directory and point it to the docs like so::

        $ man -M docs/man <page>

    Where <page> is the man page you want to view.
